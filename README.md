🖥️ Fake Hacking Terminal
🚀 This is a JavaScript practice project where I created a Fake Hacking Terminal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics a hacking sequence, displaying fake hacking logs with a loading animation before clearing up.

✨ Features
✔️ Interactive Button: Clicking the "Open" button triggers the fake hacking sequence.
✔️ Realistic Terminal Logs: Displays fake hacking logs with animated dots and "done" messages.
✔️ Randomized Timing: Each step has a randomized execution time for a more natural effect.
✔️ Background Color Change: The screen turns black during the fake hack for an immersive experience.
✔️ Self-Clearing Terminal: After finishing, the terminal disappears.
